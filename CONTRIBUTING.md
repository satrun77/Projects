How to Contribute
==================

## Solutions

Please **do not send pull requests for replacing my code**. If you'd like to contribute solutions, please see the following instructions:

- Solve the problem, and keep it in your repo. DO NOT send merge request yet.

- [Open an issue](https://github.com/thekarangoel/Projects/issues/new) with the following details - problem you solved, language used, and a link to the solution.

- The link to your solution will be present in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/thekarangoel/6088143) like so:
    
    **This is a problem** - And here goes it's description. [[octocat (Python)]](link-to-octocats-solution) [[your_username(C++)]](link-to-your-solution)

- That's it. As soon as I get online I'll add the link to the gist! You do not need to do anything else.

=====================================

## Projects

If you have suggestions for adding or removing projects, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/thekarangoel/Projects/issues/new) to discuss it, or directly create a pull request after you edit the *README.md* file with necessary changes. If you add a problem, make sure you add it in the correct category.

It is required that any changes made to the projects (this does not include adding solutions) in *README.md*, must be reflected in *README-scratch.md* and in *README.md* file in the relevant category folder. If you're copying a project from some other webpage, you **MUST** link to it in the *Sources* section at the bottom of repo's *README.md* and *README-scratch.md*.

If you skip any step(s), I will not merge the changes!
